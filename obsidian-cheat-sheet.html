           <summary style="font-size:20;color:#ff99cc">Story of a boy</summary><br />
           <p>A boy broke something of his auntie Esther's. The dad told the boy that he has to go and tell Auntie what he had done. Now, the Auntie already knew of what he had done and has already forgiven him. The boy was not under condemnation with his Auntie Esther. But the boy had to be accountable and need to go and tell his Aunt what he had done. Allen told his dad "but she already knows what I did!"</p><br />
            <p>God already knows what we have done, but we still have to give an account. And this account includes what is good and what is bad. The bad is forgiven, and the good will be rewarded. Such grace should instill in us a sense of praise for God who is so merciful.</p><br />
