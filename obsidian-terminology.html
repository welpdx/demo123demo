&gt; -   Task management is organizing your tasks, keeping track of your commitments and appointments, and trying not to forget anything. Typical GTD or daily notes plugin things.<br />
&gt; -   Knowledge management is about organizing and being able to (re)find knowledge/resources that you collect. I think this is what most people use Obsidian for. I see MOCs the way they often are advertised as a great example for that, or also the Zotero workflows.<br />
&gt; -   Knowledge development is about learning new things, being creative, making new hypotheses and trying to validate/contradict them, and maybe becoming a better person. This is what I think Luhmann really did with his Zettelkasten. Another great example is <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/u/nickmilo">@nickmilo</a>â€™s latest video with <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/u/eleanorkonik">@EleanorKonik</a>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO5N_x2so0g">How to turn yo 4</a></li>
