<p>I need the freedom to do what I have thought through and decided. I've noticed that everytime I've made a decision to move forward in a direction I am comfortable with, I am shut down. They pressure me with their own ideas of how to do things. They pressure me with their estimations of my progress, of my future looks like when I make the decisions I've decided to take.   </p>

<p>I need to assert myself and say no more to this. Sure they may have their points at certain times. But I need to realize that this is my life, and I need to take responsibility for myself.</p>

<p>Tonight, I have decided that I would need to invest some time into PIM (Personal Information Management). I think that this would help feel decluttered and free, when I am reading and learning new things, I have somewhere to put them and feel like I have the possibility of retrieving it. </p>

<p>Mom's response is of worry. </p>

<ol>
<li>I ask her immediately if she feels worried. She denies that and says she is not worried about me and about my decision blah blah blah.</li>
<li>But right away she asks: Does this help with Assighment 4? </li>
<li>I replied no, but I guess I can make it help with assignment 4. </li>
<li>After that response, she asks: what is your priority?.... Me:  Here we go again. you are worried. </li>
<li>Then, mom: blah blah blah, you are going to be 40 and can't make right decisions. I am confused at why....</li>
</ol>

<p>I am no longer letting mom's worry and her impression of things to pressure me and suppress me. </p>

<p>From now on, I will think of things logically. </p>

<p>Logical analysis of PIM in a crunch time:</p>

<p>Why I should:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am always bothered by how I recorded my notes. It is recorded in a way that is hard to recall and review. </li>
<li>I am going to be learning alot of things, even English stuff (like sentence structure, terms, etc.). If I don't start now, it is going to go downhill from here</li>
<li>I feel motivated to take on this project. I want this motivation to be productive to continue, and maybe replace unproductive behaviour. </li>
<li>This won't take that long. So far, time distribution:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>mid t -  for getting started. Know the fundamentals and introduced to what I am to expect for my PIM</li><br />
<li>little t - to get set up and coding</li><br />
<li>big t - recording notes about my PIM learning</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Why I shouldn't:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am in crunch time. I do not have time to spare for anything else. </li>
<li>Don't want mom upset with me. What her to be on the same side as me.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Rebuttal. I have made my decision. It does not take long. She assumes it does. That is her assumption. She also assumes that if I do this and "sidetrack", that definetly and undeniabily will extend my essay writing time. </li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion: I think I should. As long as I am focused on the task at hand and I am being productive, I think that overshadows anything else. Rn, I am making little progress as I am basically distracted with gaming. I was doing avoidance coping. I didn't want to think about ENGL 255, as I do not know how to move forward, what the issue is that is holding me back (actually i do know: it is making a decision and also requires more reading, which requires good note taking, and i am not taking good notes because it is hand written and I feel like it is a waste of time or something.)</p>
