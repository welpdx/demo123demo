<li>Unable to let go.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>I have an issue of not wanting to discard things. I find and read alot of things on the internet. But, alot of times, what I see is garbage. <strong>I don't need to put all I've read into the keep bucket</strong>.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Distracted<br />
<ul><br />
<li>I have to be vigilant in taking the time to reflect. Am I on track? Is what I am doing right now a distraction, unneccessary, off track?</li><br />
<li>I have to proactively manage the content I am viewing<br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>Since I am on crunch time with Engl255, I can't afford spending time on other things (like theology or what not). This is an important, and eye opening realization: I have to focus <strong>solely</strong> on the area of my study. This way, I walk away with good knowledge of the area of study that I was working on. <span id="l3grzs3"></span></li><br /><br />

<li>Learn to discern when my hobby interferes with my main goals</li>
<li>Know my limitations.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>3 philsophy courses will probably take all my time. When I am taking those three phil courses, I have to set aside videos on theology or other stuff, despite them being interesting. </li><br />
<li>Maybe watch philosophy videos instead? Those videos may also help with understanding my course, right</li><br />

<li>Motivation<br />
<ul><br />
<li>It is hard for other people to help you determine what motivates you etc.</li><br />
<li>Motivation is easier to be established by yourself. </li><br />
